Hi! I'm Jake.

I am a mathematician by training. I got my PhD in Jan 2022, and my research interests include mapping class groups, Out(F_n), and their Torelli subgroups.

Most recently, though, my interests have drawn me to programming. The technologies I use most often are:
- Python
- JavaScript (and some React)
- AWS

My latest project is a website that solves the [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
I started this project to help practice with the AWS infrastructure (particularly API Gateway, Lambda, and S3). 

To help hold myself accountable, here is a list of the things I'd like to learn more about:
- More AWS (potentially with some certifications)
- Docker/Kubernetes
- A backend Python framework (Django/Flask)
